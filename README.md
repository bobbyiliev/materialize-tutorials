# [Materialize](https://materialize.com) Tutorials

This is a collection of my personal Materialize demos and tutorials.

Materialize is a streaming database for real-time analytics. It was launched in 2019 to address the growing need for the ability to build real-time applications easily and efficiently on streaming data so that businesses can obtain actionable intelligence from streaming data.

Materialize is built upon [Timely Dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow) and [Differential Dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow).
